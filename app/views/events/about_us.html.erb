   <p>Gathr Group is the spawn of the wiley minds of Kevin Hein and Troy Cox. Gathr Group is dedicated to helping people socialize and engage while exploring everything the city Pittsburgh has to offer. HoursPGH is their first project with this aim focused on the service industry helping people find new happy hours and specials to explore with friends. HoursPGH is meant to be a centralized place where people who live in Pittsburgh and those who are visiting can find the best happy hours, daily specials, off menu featured dishes and beer list Pittsburgh has to offer.  We hope to make the experience different from what you have seen before by providing restaurants with control of their own profile so they are able to update the information in real-time providing you with the most up to date information possible. You want to know this information. They want you to know this information. GIVE THE PEOPLE WHAT THEY WANT!<br>

No longer will you have to read/memorize the endless blackboards and posters throughout the city. Explore restaurants you havenâ€™t been before, meet new people, show visitors why Pittsburgh is one of the greatest cities in the world! </p>
